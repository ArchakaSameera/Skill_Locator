# Skill_Locator
Locates geographical distribution of opportunities for a particular skill set.  

## Description:
Wouldn't it be great if you were to visualize the geographical distribution of opportunities for your skills set? Something a job seeker can use to make an informed and wise decision before making next switch. Skill locator does this along with an integrated AI bot with which user can interact with.  

It takes in a job-seekers skillset and desired work locations, and then outputs locations in real-time where there are opportunities for the job-seekersâ€™ skill sets. This is accomplished by filtering the job-seekers input through the AI-bot that seeks out keywords related to technical skills and location. Those keywords are then used as tags when filtering through a database of jobs matching the job-seekers skillsets. Lastly, those resulting jobs are then geolocated on Google Maps for the job-seeker to visualize the global demand distribution for his skill set. Ultimately, Skill Locator will broaden the horizon for job-seekers as to where their skills are in demand geographically.
